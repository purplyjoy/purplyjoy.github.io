                            Today we set up our shared repository and project directory in Github where I collaborated with my partner and our professor. At first, I had some difficulty using the Git comands because I'm still not very familiar with them, but after trying and applying what I've learned, I began to understand how they work.                     
                            </br></br>
                            Before starting the actual website, I focused on organizing the required files and folders to keep everything structured. I also created the initial website layout in Figma so that the coding process will be easier later. Having this visual guide will help me stay consistent design and make development more organized.
                            </br></br>
                            Once I completed the layout, I took some time to rest and planned to start building the actual website the following day. I'm looking forward to finishing this portfolio because it gives me the opportunity to present who I am, including my interests and personal goals. Since the website also features a blog, I'm glad to have a place where I can share my experiences and moments from my life.

                        <p class="preview">
                            Today is the second day of working on my portfolio website. I already have an initial layout for my website, which makes creating the site much easier and faster. I began by building the home page, adding all the necessary information into the HTML file. Having a guide to follow helped me a lot, I didn't have to spend time thinking about what to do next. I could simply follow the layout I designed and implement it on the website.                      
                            </br></br>
                            Since I had a face-to-face class at 1 pm, I wasn't able to make any commits in the morning or afternoon. After returning home, I took a photo of myself still in uniform for the portfolio because I didn't have any formal picture in uniform. I took a few shots and then decided which photos I'll use. 
                            </br></br>
                            I continued working on my website later at night. Before that, I spent some time playing Mobile Legends with my sisters and cousins and roblox with my online friend, which I haven't been able to play with these past few days because of me getting busy with schoolwork. We played only for a few minute and then I had to get back to my work. 
                            </br></br>
                            Even though I haven't finished an entire page yet, I made some progress. I am now able to understand how the Git works and getting familiar of the steps after I add and commit, which is to git pull where I have to merge the folders and files in the shared repository. It is a very important step because that way, both me and my partner can commit on our own directory without affecting someone else's work in the shared repository.

                        <p class="preview">
                            I made a lot of progress today and I'm now almost done with my portfolio website. It feels satisfying to finally see how the website looks in reality and how it actually works.
                            </br></br>
                            I once created a blog website using Wix, where templates were already provided. I used that site today as part of my layout inspiration. The blog page of my portfolio is inspired by that website because it's one of the nostalgic projects I've had. It was a blog website where I shared things about myself, specifically my hobbies and interests. Since the photos on that website are already outdated, I had to look for new ones to include in my website. I even took out my photo album and captured a page showing the photobooth pictures I've taken with my friends and family.                    
                            </br></br>                            
                            I created that Wix site during senior high school, and I still have access to it until now. However, some part can no longer be accessed, which sadden me because those were the blog posts where where I shared more detailed stories. I can still see the titles of the posts, but I can't open the full content anymore. Even so, I'm thankful I can still visit the site and use it as an inspiration today, and in the future whenever I want to look back on my past self.
                            </br></br>
                            Since I already added the initial details for the blog page, I will just have to follow the layout and continue creating blog posts. I've already finished the home, portfolio and about pages, and now that I'm working on the blog page, I can clearly see most of the portfolio website coming together. I'm really excited to finish this project. If I still have time after completing everything, I plan to add more details and improve the design to make it look more visually appealing.
                            </br></br>
                            Today felt like a really long day because I spent most of my time focused on working on the website. Even though it was tiring, I enjoyed the process, which made the work feel easier and more fulfilling.

                        <p class="preview">
                            During the creation of my portfolio website, I recalled many memories that I preserved through images. I was just looking for a photo of a scenery I had captured before, but then I caught a glimpse of past events in my life.
                            </br></br>
                            This image is one of those that reminded me of momens in my life. It was taken during a summer break, when I was just about to become a college student. I was with my childhood best friends, Riza and Roselyn, who are now both in their first year in college. We used to hangout all the time back when we're still in elementary and high school, and this was one of our bonding, secretly riding a motorcycle with Riza guiding us. I tried driving by myself even with my fear of getting into an accident, not because of getting hurt, but because none of my parents knew that I was outside and doing a dangerous act. They didn’t want me to learn to ride a motorcycle because they thought it was dangerous, but my stubborn younger self did the opposite. Even so, I never truly had the chance to learn how to ride properly. Luckily, we didn't get into an accident that time; rather, we had a lot of fun and enjoyed our time together. 
                            </br></br>
                            But I didn't know that it would be the last time I could try to ride a motorcycle because we can't ride together anymore. Even though we're neighbors and we literally just have to walk a few steps to get to each other's houses, we never really have time to hangout now. We're all busy with our own lives, and we only get the chance to see each other once in blue moon. Luckily, we were able to go out together last January 8, because of Riza's birthday, which was a year after our last hangout with all the three of us present. Because of conflicting schedules, we rarely get to be together as a complete group. With this simple image, I recalled a lot of memories and the emotions I had at that time. It made me miss them more, and I hope we see each other again soon.            
                            </br></br>
                            Another memory that I recalled was just last year. I saw the images that I captured using the iPad. It was the time when my phone broke and I didn't have a replacement so I had to use my sister's iPad, bringing it outside even if it's too big and heavy. I remembered how unfamiliar the vibe was during that time, when I had to carry that big iPad, to take pictures or watch videos, which would really catch someone else's attention. I know it's normal to use an iPad, but it's really weird and unfamiliar for me because that was the first time in my life that I had to use an iPad for my daily activities.
                            </br></br>
                            It felt even weirder because I lost access to my Instagram and Facebook accounts. It really frustrated me because I treasure those accounts. They are one of the ways I can relive moments of my life. I no longer have access to those social media accounts and I had to make new ones. Since then, my life has been different, quiet but not peaceful. I felt like I was away from a few people. My life have been a little quieter because my social media accounts are empty. That's when I realized how dependent I had become on the Internet, I realize how my world revolved around it. 
                            </br></br>
                            Although it may have negative effects on me, I am thankful for having technology because it is also a way to preserve and relive moments from my life. Since I lost my phone, I didn't have the chance to recover some of the photos I've kept there. I forgot to upload them to my Gdrive, where I keep the important images I want to save. From now on, whenever there's something to keep, I immediately upload it to Gdrive. I am thinking of other ways to preserve my photos, but this one works good for me. 
                            </br></br>
                            During that timeline of my life — losing my phone and had to use an iPad, losing access to my social media accounts and making new ones, and forgetting to upload some of my cherished moments to Gdrive,  then learning to always upload them from now on — I experienced so many emotions and that it almost felt strange. Those images that I captured using the iPad are all here on my current device and also uploaded to the Gdrive. And those images that I forgot to upload, I guess I'll just have to recall them through my own memory.

                                Finally, my portfolio website is complete. Everything I wanted to include is there, and I am very satisfied with the result. My favorite part of the website is my blog. I love sharing things about myself, and whenever I have the chance to tell my story, I gladly do so. That makes the blog the best part of my website, as it allows me to share the experiences and moments that shaped my life.
                                </br></br>
                                Looking back at my past experiences while writing for the memories blog made me emotional. While taking pictures of my photo albums and diaries, I became teary, reminiscing about those moments. I remembered how much I loved writing in my diary, documenting my days and the emotions I felt. I really miss the times when I was always writing and decorating my notebooks. Since my senior high school days, my daily life has mostly revolved around my phone. Even so, I continue to write diaries in my phone’s Notes app because I want to preserve and remember my experiences. Although life has changed, a part of my past still lingers in the present. I will never forget who I used to be and the things I loved doing before.

                            Sometimes, the simplest moments bring the deepest sense of peace. In a world full of noise, responsibilities, and endless thoughts, finding a place where the mind can rest feels truly priceless. For me, that sense of comfort comes from witnessing breathtaking views — quiet, beautiful scenes that allow me to pause, breathe, and feel free from the weight of my worries.

More than simple entertainment, games create memories, friendships, and stories that stay with us even after the screen is turned off.

                            Events in our lives, whether they are big and unforgettable or small and simple, can always be written down in a diary. For me, keeping a diary is something meaningful and comforting. It allows me to capture moments that might otherwise fade with time. Even the ordinary days—when nothing extraordinary seems to happen—become special once they are written on paper, because they represent a part of my journey.
                            </br></br>   
                            Writing in my diary is both enjoyable and therapeutic. It provides a safe space where I can openly share my thoughts, feelings, and experiences without worrying about being judged. At the end of each day, I like to sit down and reflect on everything that happened—what made me smile, what challenged me, and what lessons I gained. Through this habit of writing, I learn more about myself and become more aware of my emotions.
                            </br></br>
                            I often reread what I have written in my diary. When I do, I am reminded of the person I was during those times. It feels like revisiting a younger version of myself, seeing how much I have grown and changed. Sometimes I laugh at my old thoughts, and sometimes I feel emotional remembering moments I had forgotten. My diary becomes a time capsule of my life, preserving memories that I can look back on whenever I want to reflect on my journey.

                        <p class="preview">
                            Music plays a major role in everyday life. It is not only a popular form of leisure but also helps with many daily activities, including traveling, exercising, and focusing on intellectual work. People listen to music for enjoyment, and also to influence or enhance their moods.
                            </br></br>
                            Every beat in music gives off different vibes and emotions. I listen to music in many ways depending on how I feel. When I’m sad, I play slow or melancholic songs so I can feel that someone else shares my emotions. I also listen to upbeat music to lift my spirits, helping me forget my worries and simply enjoy the rhythm. When I'm happy, I choose lively songs to feel more productive and energetic. I also love listening to love songs—they make me feel the emotions of love and imagine what it would be like to be deeply in love, even though I haven’t experienced it yet. Love songs make the world feel beautiful, reminding me of the people I cherish and care for.
                            </br></br>
                            I have been organizing my music playlists on Spotify so it's easier for me to choose what kind of music I want to listen to. I enjoy exploring different genres, so much that I don't even sure if I have a favorite. I listen to anything that catches my interest, letting my mood guide my choices. 
                            </br></br>
                            I don't only love listening to music through my devices, but also live. Whenever I have the chance to attend a free concert in our city, I make sure to grab the opportunity and fully enjoy the moment. I love hearing live vocals because I can feel the artist's emotions through the microphone. Being in the same space as the performers allows me to experience the music more deeply and truly connect with each lyric and rhythm.

                            I have always dreamed of attending a concert by famous bands and immersing myself in their live performance. Since I can’t experience it yet, I hold onto the hope that I will someday fulfill that dream. It serves as an inspiration to keep going and work toward my goals. Everything I want to have or experience in the present becomes motivation, reminding me that I can make these dreams a reality in the future.
