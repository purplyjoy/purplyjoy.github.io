                    Memorable moments in life are meant to be treasured and remembered. We never know what experiences await us in the future, but it is important to value what we have already encountered. Even the simple things we accomplish help shape who we are today and who we will become in the future.
                    </br></br>
                    My family used to live in a traditional nipa hut, a small house that could easily be swept away by a strong typhoon. So, whenever there is a coming disaster we all pack our things and wrap them in plastic. I remember how devastated I was when I forgot about my photo album from Grade 7. It was soaked in water and all the photos I've kept were all ruined. I really loved that photo album because it was a gift from my friend when we had our own exchange gift on Christmas. That's when I became more sentimental about the gifts I received because I don't know when I'll lose them. Since then, I always keep all the important things in a storage box and make sure it will not be wet by the rain. In that box, all the memorable things in my life are kept. I have a new photo album where I will make sure from now on not to get soaked in water. I also kept all the letters I received from my friends. Some of the notebooks and papers I used during high school are also in there. Everything that I want to keep are piled up, including my diaries I used back from my elementary and high school days. 
                    </br></br>
                    While I was looking through that storage box, I saw and reread all the things I had done before. I realized that I used to be such an enthusiastic person, and all those happy moments were written in my diary. Even though I no longer write in a physical notebook, I still keep my thoughts in the notes on my phone. Reading them brought back so many memories and allowed me to feel the same emotions I felt during those times. I truly loved being a child, and I will always cherish that phase of my life.
                    </br></br>
                    Another way I preserve my memories is through Google Drive, where I upload photos and videos that I want to keep for the long term. I organize everything into separate folders, so I always know exactly where to find the photos or videos I want to look at and remember. Every small event in my life, no matter how ordinary it may seem, becomes meaningful when I capture it, and I make sure to upload it to Google Drive. This way, I can revisit those moments anytime and reminisce about the experiences, the people I shared them with, and the feelings I had at that time. Over the years, my collection has grown into a personal archive of memories— a digital photo album that reminds me of my journey, my growth, and the countless moments that have shaped who I am today.
                    </br></br>
                    Everything I have experienced in life has taught me valuable lessons and helped me grow into the person I am today and who I will become in the future. The memories I have kept will always serve as reminders of my journey and motivate me to keep working hard toward my dreams. I have set a goal of collecting even more memories and organizing them into carefully arranged photo albums. Each memory will have its own place and in their respective folders for different types of memories, so each album is organized based on what the photos are about, making it easier to revisit and reflect on the moments I’ve captured. These memories will not only preserve my past but also inspire me to pursue my dreams and embrace new experiences that I have longed for, reminding me that every step of my journey matters.
