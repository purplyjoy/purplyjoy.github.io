                    The computer has always been one of the most fascinating inventions for me, especially because it allows me to play online games. I really just became an IT student to feed my curiosity about how they work, because honestly I think it's magic. Through computers, I can connect with people from all over the world and share experiences in ways that weren’t possible before. Online games, in particular, have given me the chance to interact, compete, and cooperate with others, all through a single device.
                    </br></br>
                    I play games not just for fun, but also for people and experience. Mobile Legends is the main game I play. It was introduced to me back from when there's a pandemic. I used to think it was just a lousy game because it was played by my guy classmates who are all loud and messy. But once I tried and learned playing it, I loved it. I became one of those what they say "ml addict", who never sleep and eat because their time was too occupied by the game. Because what else would we do at home other than playing games? It was a lockdown and everything was done at home. My schoolworks are just sent to our place and I will work on it right after receiving and then spend the rest of the week playing games. I was always scolded because of my behaviors while playing game, and I think it does affected me negatively. I had tantrums during the game and would often shout curse words. But I'm already done from that phase since I already grew up. That's the negative part of online games, but I love the other side of it. The positive side, which is the people.
                    </br></br>
                    I made a lot of online friends during the pandemic. We would always play and spend our time together. Those friends taught me a lot of things. Some of them are college students at that time, some even are already working, and of course there are same age as me. They shared different stories and experiences, and it's not about the game anymore, it's about life. How they handle things that worries them, and how they try to reduce their stress by playing games. I loved those time that I was still young and free, everything was fun and interesting. Simple games with friends already excite me and I will always love to go back to the time that I'm still a teenager without a lot of burden in life. But since people grow up and change, my time with online games had lessen. When the pandemic ended and face-to-face classes returned, I lost contact with my online friends. I forgot their names and accounts. But I know that some of them are still on my friends list because I don't remove any followers on my account. Mobile Legend is such a great experience during the pandemic, but I hope the pandemic never happen again.
                    </br></br>
                    Roblox, another game I play. It's a lot different from Mobile Legends because it has a lot of games inside that game itself. There are many game that I can choose to play. I can build houses, draw objects, style outfits, design a garden, drive cars and so much more. With so many choices, it sometimes feels overwhelming. I had played roblox before, but the year I played it most of the time was last year, 2025. That was when Grow a Garden became a famous game on Roblox. At first, I thought it was boring, just like how I once thought Mobile Legends was boring. But notice the pattern - whenever I think a game is boring, I eventually get addicted to it.
                    </br></br>
                    Last year was a roller coaster of experience. I played the grow a garden game because of my sister's influence. It was when she was already on her summer break, while me as a college student, was still on the last semester. I didn't think of playing it at first, but when I played it once, I was hooked. I also got addicted with the game because it's really fun and interesting. There's an event every week that we will wait so that we can mutate our plants in the garden and make more sheckels. I'm not for the value there, I was for the garden. I would just open the game to fix my garden and create the garden layout I saw on tiktok. It was a fun experience, but the game lost it's spark after everyone made a lot of sheckles and thought that it lost it's value. I'm not playing the game anymore, but it was a great experience. 
                    </br></br>
                    Even after the summer break, I was still playing roblox because that's my escape from everything. I had a time the I felt like everyone hates me, and all I can think about was immerse myself in the game. I played mountain games in roblox, where I will have to climb the mountain with obstacles. It's just like an obby game but there are checkpoints and a peak because it's a mountain. Since the IT department is on a virtual classes, because the building is on renovation, I am still able to play games. I'm always at home and that's all I do whenever I have time. 
                    </br></br>
                    Roblox is where I met my online friend, Ash. She's one of those people I met and spent time playing with. We have a lot of similarities, that is why we're so close and understanding of each other. Even though we're in the same country, we're still separated by a 400km distance. I guess that's the cons of having an online friend, you can't meet them in person even if you want to. But even so, we still have our strong friendship, built from bond, emotions, and experience. We started from a game and into a friendship that lasted longer than expected. And I'm thankful for being able to meet a person that will be by my side, even just virtually, and motivates me to trust myself and keep on working hard.

                    Game is not just a game; it is an experience filled with emotions, learning, and interaction. It brings people together, allowing everyone to meet, connect, and share moments with one another. More than simple entertainment, games create memories, friendships, and stories that stay with us even after the screen is turned off.
